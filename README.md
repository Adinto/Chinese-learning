This article is all about a new AI assistant that's here to help primary and secondary school students who need to memorize language texts and understand ancient translations after school. It's designed to make this task easier for students by using a large language model, which means less work for the adults who accompany their children to study.
The project is based on InternLM, which implements the scoring of retelling and reciting content for primary school students. The repo of the practical camp is https://github.com/InternLM/Tutorial/discussions/1998.

本文重点介绍一款新型人工智能助手，它将帮助需要在课后背诵文言文和理解古文译文的中小学生。它的设计初衷是通过使用大规模语言模型让学生更轻松地完成这项任务，这也意味着陪伴孩子学习的成年人可以减少工作量。
该项目基于InternLM实现了对于小学生复述、背诵内容的评分，实战营的repo 是https://github.com/InternLM/Tutorial/discussions/1998
